# Recap

Fortna on making peace last:

* Changing incentives
* Reducing uncertainty
* Managing accidents

---

# What's Missing

Political issues determine whether war breaks out in the first place.

Don't they also play a role in the resumption of war?

^ Wars are fought over things

^ Distinguish between technical and political

^ Recall how in the bargaining model, conflict can only happen if someone is dissatisfied with the status quo

# Recap: Bargaining Model of War

* Puzzle of war
    * War is inefficient
    * Mutually preferable settlements exist
* Why war occurs
    * Uncertainty → don't know what others are willing to accept
    * Incentives to misrepresent

---

# Expectations

**Convergent:** Similar idea of likely war outcomes.

**Divergent:** Different ideas of likely outcomes—each side overly optimistic.

---

# Werner and Yuen: Premises

1. War occurs because states:
    * Have a conflict of interest
    * Have divergent expectations about the outcome of war
2. Battle outcomes shape states' expectations.

^ So the purpose of war, in a sense, is to get us on the same page about what further war can achieve

---

# Werner and Yuen: Conclusions

* Consistent battle outcomes → Longer peace
* "Interrupted" war → Shorter peace

---

# Empirical Analysis

* Unit of analysis: ceasefire (same as Fortna)
* Dependent variable: duration of peace
* Independent variables:
    * Battle consistency: portion of conflict one side consistently won
    * Interruption: ceasefire due to third-party pressure

^ Note how the underlying mechanism isn't directly tested here

---

# Findings

* Consistent battle outcomes → Longer peace
* "Interrupted" war → Shorter peace
* Mitigated effect of Fortna's "agreement strength"

---

# Implications

* Political aspects of post-war agreements matter
* ...but so do the trust-building aspects
* Ambiguous role of third parties
* Making peace is hard
