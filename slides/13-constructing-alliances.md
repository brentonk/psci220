# Importance of Alliances

* Biggest crises involve more than two states
* Allies shape balance of power
* Credible alliance commitments can deter conflict

---

# Questions about Alliances

1. Who will states seek out as allies?
2. Why make formal alliance commitments?

^ First boils down in some ways to "What are states interested in?" (contrast realism and liberalism, security dilemma and spiral model)

^ Second is due to anarchy

# Walt on Alliances

Central question: Who will states seek out as allies?

Three models of motivation:

* Power politics
* State similarity
* Foreign aid (or bribes)

---

# Power Politics

States choose allies so as to maximize their own security or power.

* *Realpolitik* dominates
* Allies depend on nature of threat

^ Connect to realism

^ Realpolitik: hard-headed considerations of interest, without sentiment or even similarity (example: US and Iran working together against ISIS)

^ Nature of threat: a state's security interests depend on which threats are present, so different threats imply different optimal allies

---

# Two Forms of Power-Politics Alliance

**Balancing:** To ally against the biggest threat.

**Bandwagoning:** To ally alongside the biggest threat.

---

# Theory of Balancing

* States seek to maximize their own security
* Deterrence is most likely to succeed when power is balanced

Therefore, states build balancing alliances.

---

# Theory of Bandwagoning

* States seek to maximize their own security
* States prefer not to attack their own allies

Therefore, states bandwagon.

^ Joining threat: more chance of victory, less chance of being a victim either way

^ On other side of threat: less chance of victory, and worse outcome in case of loss

---

# Balancing versus Bandwagoning

* Effects of making a threat
    * Balance: lose allies
    * Bandwagon: gain allies
* Composition of wartime coalitions
    * Balance: fairly even
    * Bandwagon: overwhelming superiority
* Battle results
    * Balance: lose battles → gain allies?
    * Bandwagon: lose battles → lose allies?

# Balancing versus Bandwagoning

The premises aren't incompatible—so why opposite conclusions?

# Walt's Argument

"Balancing should be preferred for the simple reason that no statesman can be completely sure of what another will do" (p. 29).

^ Does this make sense?  Should uncertainty favor balancing, not bandwagoning?

---

# State Similarity

States ally with those most like them.

* Main example: ideology (e.g., NATO, Warsaw Pact)
* Could also be culture, language, regime type, etc.

---

# Theory of Ideological Alliances

* Similar ideology → similar interests
* States won't fight if their interests don't clash

Therefore, states build ideological alliances.

^ Logic is that you gain power at no cost, since you don't have to worry about being the next victim (unlike in bandwagoning alliances)

---

# Power Politics versus State Similarity

* Duration of alliances
    * PP: unstable
    * SS: stable
* When changes in alliances happen
    * PP: when new threats arise
    * SS: domestic turmoil

^ Are these competing theories, or do they explain different kinds of alliances?

---

# Foreign Aid

Small states sell their allegiance to the highest bidder.

---

# Theory of "Bribe" Alliances

* States (or leaders) seek to maximize wealth
* War victory is worth paying for

Therefore, states under threat bid for allies, and the highest bids succeed.

---

# Problems with the Bribe Theory

* Doesn't explain: whose support to bid for?
* Economic logic is sketchy

---

# Bribes and Balancing

* Imagine both sides roughly balanced
* Small change could make major difference
* Why not bribe someone to switch?
* And once they switch...

---

# For Next Time

* Read Morrow, "Alliances: Why Write Them Down?" and Leeds et al., "Reevaluating Alliance Reliability"
