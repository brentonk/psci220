# Today's Agenda

1. The spiral model and the security dilemma.
2. Deciding which model is best.

---

# The
# [fit] Spiral Model
# and the security dilemma

---

# Recap: Rational Deterrence Theory

1. States want more territory and influence,
2. But territory and influence < being nuked.
3. These preferences are common knowledge.

Therefore, making a credible nuclear threat increases a state's security.

# Yet Another Mugging Analogy

Walking down a dim alley, you see a stranger.

You say to him, "If you even think about mugging me, you'll regret it."

Are you now more or less safe?

^ Similarly: Does carrying a bazooka in public make you more or less safe?

---

# The Spiral Model

Making a threat reduces a state's security by causing a spiral of hostility.

^ I threaten you, you think I have bad intentions, you threaten me, ...

^ Intentions: a word we didn't use when talking about Schelling

---

# Premises of the Spiral Model

1. States differ in their intentions.
    * Status quo
    * Revisionist
2. A state's intentions are private information.
    * Not common knowledge
3. A state's foreign policy is a signal of its intentions.

^ Logical coherence?

^ Parsimony, plausibility?

---

# Signaling

If your preferences are private information, we can infer them—at least partly—from your actions.

---

# Foreign Policy as a Signal

Assume that:

* Revisionist states almost always make threats
* Status quo states usually don't make threats

What should the target of a threat infer?

How should the target respond?

---

# Signaling
## (mathematical aside for those who have taken stats)

Signaling is a conditional probability problem.

$$
\begin{align}
&\Pr(\text{revisionist} \,|\, \text{makes threat})
\\[0.5em]
&\quad=
\frac{\Pr(\text{revisionist and makes threat})}{\Pr(\text{makes threat})}
\\[0.5em]
&\quad=
\frac{\Pr(\text{revisionist and makes threat})}{\Pr(\text{revisionist and makes threat}) + \Pr(\text{status quo and makes threat})}
\end{align}
$$

# Signaling and Spiraling
## or: how believing in deterrence theory makes us less safe

We build capabilities, make threats
→ They infer we're revisionist
→ They build capabilities, make threats
→ We escalate our arms and threats
→ They escalate further
→ ...

^ Why isn't this true under RDT?  (Connect to common knowledge.)

# Conclusions of the Spiral Model
## The Security Dilemma

Actions a state takes to increase its security may have the opposite consequence.

^ And the reason is that these actions increase other states' fears of hostile intentions

---

# Conclusions of the Spiral Model
## Interdependence and Resolve

Deterrence theory:<br/>If you give an inch, they'll take a mile.

Spiral model:<br/>If you give an inch, you might stop the spiral.

---

# Objections to the Spiral Model

* Why don't states apply their standards for others to themselves?
* Why would a state making a *deterrent* threat be perceived as revisionist?
* Hasn't appeasement failed?

---

# [fit] Deciding
# which model is best

---

# Deterrence Theory versus the Spiral Model

How do we decide which is "better"?

* Evaluate logical consistency and parsimony
* Derive empirical implications and compare to historical record

---

# Empirical Implications

What would count as evidence in favor of the spiral model?

* Arms races?
* Unsuccessful threats?
* Successful appeasement?

^ Deterrence theory is simple: more credibility → more safety

^ Need to find situations where war follows threat, but would not have occurred if a threat had not been issued

---

# The Implications Are Not Straightforward

The spiral model's predictions depend on factors that are difficult, if not impossible, to measure:

* how many states are revisionist
* which particular states are revisionist
* states' beliefs about other states

---

# The Real Question

Are the deterrence model and the spiral theory incompatible?

^ It just depends on if you know the other state is revisionist (and what they think about you)

^ Policy disagreement comes down to whether USSR is revisionist.  If that were known, both sets of theorists would agree on how to deal with them
