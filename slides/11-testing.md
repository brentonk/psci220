# [fit] Crisis Diplomacy
# A Crash Course in Empirical Analysis
# February 19, 2015

![](img/workstations.jpg)

^ Last week we used theories to interpret historical evidence.

^ Now we'll use historical evidence to test hypotheses derived from theories.

# Snow-Induced Schedule Changes

![](img/nashville-snow.jpg)

* Midterm is still on Tuesday
    * Only covers up to last week (Cuban Missile Crisis)
* Read the Huth/Russett and Lebow/Stein exchange for next Thursday
* Alliance material will start week after next

# Why Do Empirical Analysis?

* Lots of variation in the social world
* We want to know what accounts for this variation
    * Description
    * Explanation
    * Prediction
* Theories suggest where to look

^ Variation examples:
some states make threats, some don't
some threats succeed, others don't

^ "What accounts for":
for explanation — knowing "why success" may help us learn "why threaten" etc.

---

# Caveats

* No single analysis is conclusive
* Testing doesn't tell us which theories are "right"
* Theories are valuable in their own right

^ Example of theory value: rationality of irrationality (we don't see leaders act irrationally a lot, and many who do aren't especially successful, but gives us insight into states like NK)

# A Procedure for Empirical Analysis

1. State hypotheses
2. Collect data
3. Perform statistical inference

^ Inference: What we learn about our general hypotheses from our specific data

---

# Hypotheses
## Definitions

A *variable* is a feature of the world whose value may differ.

A *hypothesis* is a statement about the relationship among certain variables.

^ Context-dependence of what is a variable
(e.g., US political institutions are constant in an analysis of US states, variable in comparative analysis)

^ What are some variables in the study of crisis diplomacy?

^ We usually derive hypotheses from theories

---

# Hypotheses
## Unit of Analysis

The *unit of analysis* is the kind of entity the hypothesis is about.

* International system
* Pair of states
* Single state
* State leader

---

# Hypotheses
## Unit of Analysis

"The more states have nuclear weapons, the more often crises will end in war."

≠

"Crises between nuclear-armed states are more likely to end in war."

---

# Hypotheses
## Independent and Dependent Variables

The *dependent variable* is the phenomenon you want to explain variation in.

An *independent variable* is a variable that may account for variation in the dependent variable.

^ Changes in IV → changes in DV (but not necessarily vice versa)

---

# Hypotheses
## Falsifiability

A hypothesis is *unfalsifiable* if there is no conceivable set of evidence that would contradict it.

To be testable, a hypothesis must be falsifiable.

---

# Hypotheses
## Falsifiability

**Falsifiable:** In a crisis, nuclear threats increase the risk of war.

**Not Falsifiable:** In a crisis, nuclear threats increase the risk of war, except when the leaders are dedicated to keeping peace.

---

# Data Collection
## Universe of Cases

What data is relevant to the hypothesis?

* Same unit of analysis
* Meets all background conditions

---

# Data Collection
## Universe of Cases

"Crises between nuclear-armed states are more likely to end in war."
→ All crises

"In a crisis between nuclear-armed states, threats increase the risk of war."
→ All crises between nuclear states

---

# Data Collection
## Sampling

* Good samples
    * Full universe of cases
    * Random selection of cases
* Bad samples
    * Convenient/cherry-picked cases
    * No variation in the dependent variable

---

# Data Collection
## Operationalization

An *operationalization* is a concrete measurement of an abstract variable.

---

# Data Collection
## Operationalization

How would we operationalize...

* a nuclear threat?
* an international crisis?
* the outbreak of war?

---

# Statistical Inference

You've got a hypothesis, you've collected relevant data—now what?

You want to use the data to draw an inference about the hypothesis.

---

# Statistical Inference
## Statistical Significance

How likely would we be to observe data like this if the hypothesis *weren't* true?

* Low enough chance → "statistically significant"
* Most common means of inference (but others exist!)

---

# Summary

1. Develop hypothesis
    * What to explain? (dependent variable)
    * What explains it? (independent variables)
2. Collect appropriate data
    * Operationalize variables
3. Draw inferences

# For Next Time

* Midterm exam
    * Short essay
    * Choice among prompts
    * Open-book, open-note
    * No electronic devices
