# Recap: Democracy and Diplomacy

1. Domestic constraints and international negotiations
    * Better settlements
    * Less likely to reach them
2. Regime pairings and cooperation
    * Same type → more likely
    * Different types → less likely

^ 2: Remind about accountability and flexibility

# Democracy and Crises

Extending these theories to the realm of crises...

1. Do democracies or dictatorships have an advantage in crisis diplomacy?
2. Between what kinds of states are crises most likely to end peacefully?

---

# Crises and Audience Costs

Fearon's claims:

1. Crises end better for democracies.
2. War is least likely between states of similar regime types.

Mechanism for both: *audience costs*.

^ Note that this is in line with what we've seen from Putnam and Leeds

---

# Audience Costs

* Incurred for backing down from a crisis
* Get worse the longer the crisis goes on

^ Make it clear: audience costs are NOT costs of war, they are only incurred if you back down

---

# Where do audience costs come from?

^ In other words: what makes it costly for a leader to back down from a commitment to win in a crisis?

---

# Democracies and Audience Costs

Folk wisdom about democracies:

* Audience costs are greater
* Generated more quickly

^ Does this mean democratic audiences have higher say in foreign policy?

^ Henceforth calling high-AC "democracy", low-AC "autocracy"

---

# Crises as Wars of Attrition

Fearon's model:

* States uncertain of each others' *resolve*
    * War costs
* Crises take place over *time*
* States' options every moment:
    * Wait (escalate)
    * Fight (pay war costs)
    * Back down (pay audience costs)

^ Crucial assumption: audience costs grow over course of crisis, war costs don't

^ If you know you're going to back down, best to do immediately

---

# The Conflict Horizon

If a crisis goes on long enough, *war is inevitable*.

^ Audience costs going up over time

^ At a certain point—the horizon—both sides would rather fight than back down because of the audience costs

---

# Choices in a Crisis

Why escalate?

* Reward: greater chance opponent backs down
* Risks:
    * Increase audience costs
    * Inch closer to horizon—more chance of war

^ Reward is chance opponent less resolved than you, risk is chance he's more so

---

# Escalation as a Signal

The more resolved a state is, the longer it is willing to escalate.

The longer your opponent keeps escalating...

* the more resolved you think they are
* the more willing you are to back down

---

# Effects of Higher Audience Costs

* Signal resolve more quickly
* Get locked in more quickly

---

# Crises between Democracies

Both states have high audience costs.

* Short horizon
* Unresolved states quickly back down
* Least resolved state always reaches its breaking point first

^ Each state faces a moment (no later than the horizon) when it will be locked in to fighting if its partner doesn't back down.  So if you're *sure* the other guy is more resolved than you, at this point it's best to back down.

---

# Crises between Autocracies

Both states have low audience costs.

* Long horizon
* Unresolved states slowly—but eventually—back down
* Least resolved state always reaches its breaking point first

^ Logic for last point is the same as between democracies, since both states generate audience costs at same rate

---

# Crises in Mixed Dyads

One states with high audience costs, one state with low audience costs.

* Democracy signals resolve quickly
* Autocracy signals resolve slowly
* Unresolved autocracy → Backs down
* Highly resolved autocracy → Danger!

^ Similarities with Putnam's model: democracies win, but breakdown more likely

---

# Conclusions

* "Tie your hands"
* Democratic advantage in crises
* Democratic peace

---

# Sources of Skepticism

* Does it make sense for domestic audiences to punish their leaders for backing down?
* Do these audience costs arise in reality?
* Do leaders in crises seek to tie their hands?
* Is there a democratic advantage in audience cost generation?

^ On audiences: Remember that they're basically committing their leaders to fight wars that otherwise wouldn't be in the state's interest, according to this mechanism
