# Fortna: "Scraps of Paper?"

**Central question:** Why does peace sometimes last and sometimes fall apart?

**Central answer:** How to keep peace:

1. Change incentives
2. Reduce uncertainty
3. Manage accidents

^ Explaining variation in peace duration by variation in agreement components

---

# Why We Care

* Peacemaking policy
* Commitment theory

^ For the theory side—we've seen before the difficulty of identifying situations where we can truly measure commitments.  Like alliances, postwar peace agreements are easily observable.  Moreover, unlike alliances, we always see whether they're followed through on (given enough time)

---

# Theory

The big obstacle—why do ceasefire agreements do *anything*?

^ Connect to previous discussions about state promises, alliances, etc.

^ Signaling value and commitment value

---

# Theory: Premises

1. State leaders consider costs and benefits when choosing how to act.
2. War is costly.
3. Each state may be tempted to take advantage of the other.

^ Two important conclusions: war is possible, but its risk can be mitigated by increasing trust

---

# Changing Incentives

* Physical constraints
    * Troop withdrawals
    * Demilitarized zones
    * Arms control
* Formalization
* Third parties

^ Formalization: engages reputation

^ Third parties: distinguish from Kydd's mechanism

---

# Reducing Uncertainty

* Monitoring
    * Physical constraints
* Signaling
    * Formalization
    * Third parties

^ Recall the Stag Hunt—if you can observe the other person's choice, trust is no longer an issue

---

# Controlling Accidents

* Prevention
    * Physical constraints
* Management
    * Responsibility for internal violations
    * Peacekeepers

^ Recall the security dilemma

---

# Empirical Analysis

* Unit of analysis: Ceasefire
* Dependent variable: Duration of peace
    * Peace = absence of war
* Independent variables: aforementioned factors

---

# Potential Confounding Factors

* How war ended
* How costly it was
* Stakes of conflict
* Belligerents' history and relationship
* Belligerents' military capabilities

---

# Findings

* "Stronger" agreements → Longer peace
* Important factors
    * Demilitarized zones
    * Third-party guarantees
    * Peacekeepers
* Unimportant factors
    * Arms control
    * Mediation
    * Responsibility for internal violations

^ So what do we conclude about the three mechanisms? What have we learned about international commitments?

---

# Questions

* Causes or effects?
* How to distinguish mechanisms?
* Where's regime type?
* Why so little attention to political settlement?

^ Causes or effects: wouldn't it be impossible to set up a DMZ in the first place if one side or the other were looking to exploit the situation?
