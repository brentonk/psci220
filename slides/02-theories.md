# Your
# [fit] Questions
# for me

---

# What are you expecting from this class?

^ Understand credibility and its relation to war and peace

^ See how political scientists reason through problems

---

# What are your criteria for short papers?

^ Make a clear, sound argument and defend it

---

# What are the exams going to be like if they are open-book and open-notes?

^ Focus on synthesizing, not regurgitating

---

## What's your specific area of interest/nation of focus?<br/><br/><br/>What are you specifically interested in?  What are you researching now?

^ Formal models of international politics

^ Diplomacy and public goods: why potential contributors may be unwilling to reveal information to each other

^ Dynamics of diplomatic system: collecting data on the interplay of diplomatic relations, outbreak of crises, and war

---

# Have you ever worked in international affairs and experienced crisis diplomacy firsthand?

^ Nopeâ€”wouldn't be well suited for it

^ Studying a topic scientifically requires different skills than practicing it

^ Goal of this class isn't to turn you into diplomats

---

## Why is diplomacy failing to resolve the problems today in Syria, Ukraine, etc.?  What institutions are missing that diplomacy needs to be more successful?<br/><br/><br/>Are there cases where diplomacy simply cannot work?

^ No magic bullets

^ All the talk in the world can't change severe conflicts of interest

---

# What makes a
# [fit] Theory?

---

# Definition

A theory is a logically coherent set of statements that explain some fact (or facts).

---

# This Is Not a Theory

Democracies will never go to war with one another.

---

# This Is a Theory

A democractic government only does what the majority wants.

War is costly to the public, so a majority will not support initiating a war.

Therefore, democracies will never go to war with one another.

---

# The Purposes of Scientific Theories

* Make sense of facts we've already discovered.
* Show why things may not be what they seem.
* Suggest where we should go looking next.

---

# Evaluating Theories

* Does the conclusion follow from the premises?
* Assumptions: *parsimony* versus *plausibility*.
* What other implications does the theory have?  How well do they fit reality?

> Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.

# Creating Theories

![](img/reeses.jpg)

There's no wrong way ... as long as

1. It's logically coherent.
2. You don't test a theory using data that inspired it!

---

# A brief introduction to
# [fit] Realism

---

# Realism

The most prominent (and most contested) theory of international politics.

Morgenthau's work is prototypically realist.

---

# Realist Assumptions

1. There is an international system consisting of sovereign states.
2. The international system is anarchical.
3. The main national interest of every state is to preserve its own security and autonomy.
4. In international politics, states always prioritize this national interest.

^ Are these coherent with each other?

^ Plausibility and parsimony?

---

# Realist Conclusions

* International conflict is inevitable.
* Peace is most likely when there is a balance of power.

^ Do these follow from the assumptions?  Are any logical leaps required?

^ Do they match with reality?

---

# For Next Time

* We'll look at the role of diplomacy in realism and liberalism (a theoretical alternative to realism)
* Read Keohane and Nye 2000, "Realism and Complex Interdependence" (download from Blackboard)
