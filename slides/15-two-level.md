# Why Domestic Politics Matter for Diplomacy

Democracies and dictatorships differ in:

* preferences
* constraints
* options

^ Tie back to the notion of explaining variation

---

# Flashback: Models of Decision

* Rational actor
    * Focus on interstate strategic interactions
    * Hold fixed preferences
* Governmental politics
    * Preferences as function of internal bargaining
    * Hold fixed other states' behavior

---

# Integrating the Models

Putnam's central question: How do domestic divisions affect international bargaining?

Central answer: Strong domestic audiences...

1. decrease chances of reaching settlement
2. improve terms of settlement (if reached)

---

# The Two-Level Game
## Basic Components

* Actors
    * Governments (Level I)
    * Respective domestic audiences (Level II)
* Stakes: international policy
* Disagreement outcome: status quo
* Settlement outcome: new policy implemented

^ Disagreement here isn't war (though later we'll see models where it is)

---

# The Two-Level Game
## Sequence of Events

1. Governments bargain with each other
    * No deal → status quo
    * Deal → move onto next level
2. Domestic audiences "ratify" the deal
    * Both ratify → deal implemented
    * Either doesn't → status quo

^ Second stage is where this differs from traditional bargaining model

---

# Issue Space and Win Sets

* Continuum of possible settlements
    * distribution of a benefit
    * division of a cost
    * policy space (e.g., left-right, dove-hawk)
* **Win set:** range of outcomes an actor deems acceptable

# Issue Space and Win Sets
## Example: Tariff on Japanese Cars

```
0%                                            100%

|----------- Japan I -----------|
|-- Japan II --|

                  |------------ USA I -----------|
                                    |-- USA II --|
```

---

# Issue Space and Win Sets
## Example: Global Women's Rights

```
less                                             more

|-- Saudi I --|
         |----- Saudi II -----|

                   |---------- USA I ----------|
             |--------------- USA II ---------------|
```

---

# Attainable Outcomes

An outcome can be reached only if it lies in *every* actor's win set.

---

# Attainable Outcomes: Example

```
0**************************************             100

|--------------- USA I ---------------|

```

---

# Attainable Outcomes: Example

```
0    **********************************             100

|--------------- USA I ---------------|
     |--------------- USA II ---------------|
```

---

# Attainable Outcomes: Example

```
0         ************************                  100

|--------------- USA I ---------------|
     |--------------- USA II ---------------|

          |-------- UK I --------|

```

---

# Attainable Outcomes: Example

```
0              *******************                  100

|--------------- USA I ---------------|
     |--------------- USA II ---------------|

          |-------- UK I --------|
               |-------- UK II --------|

```

# Win Set Size

Two effects of shrinking a country's Level II win set:

1. More say in the final deal
2. Less chance of agreement altogether

---

# Win Set Size: Distributive Consequences

Smaller Level II win set → Better deal

```
none                 ************                  nuke

|------------ USA I ------------|
|------------ USA II -----------|

                     |------------ Iran I ------------|
                     |------------ Iran II -----------|
```

---

# Win Set Size: Distributive Consequences

Smaller Level II win set → Better deal

```
none                 ****                          nuke

|------------ USA I ------------|
|-------- USA II -------|

                     |------------ Iran I ------------|
                     |------------ Iran II -----------|
```

^ Counterintuitive consequence: not always best for government's preferences to be identical to public's

---

# Win Set Size: Chances of Agreement

Level II win set *too* small → No deal

```
none                 ****                          nuke

|------------ USA I ------------|
|-------- USA II -------|

                     |------------ Iran I ------------|
                     |------------ Iran II -----------|
```

---

# Win Set Size: Chances of Agreement

Level II win set *too* small → No deal

```
none                                               nuke

|------------ USA I ------------|
|----- USA II ----|

                     |------------ Iran I ------------|
                     |------------ Iran II -----------|
```

# Connections to Schelling

Taking a decision out of your hands has benefits...

... but it also has risks.

^ Benefits: credibility

^ Risks: disaster

---

# Origins of Win Sets

In a democracy, why would the leader's win set differ from the public's?

---

# Origins of Win Sets

* How the issue relates to domestic coalitions
* Domestic political institutions
* Promises by Level I leaders

---

# Expanding the Issue Space

Countries can bargain over more than one issue at once.

How does this affect Level I and Level II win sets?

And the outcomes of bargaining?

---

# Dictatorships and Democracies

Which kind of government has an advantage in two-level games?

---

# Limitations of Putnam's Analysis

What are the competing explanations?

What is this article missing?

---

# For Next Time

* Read Leeds, "Domestic Political Institutions, Credible Commitments, and International Cooperation" (JSTOR).
