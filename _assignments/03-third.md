# Instructions

Your task is to write a short paper that addresses one (and only one!) of the following questions.  Your paper should not exceed six pages, not including references.[^formatting] This is not a research paper: you should be able to answer any of the following questions satisfactorily using only works from the syllabus.  Of course, you are welcome to use other sources if they are relevant to your argument.  You must cite all sources (including works from the syllabus) and adhere to the other standards of academic honesty laid out in the syllabus.[^honesty]

The paper is due to me at the beginning of class on **Tuesday, April 14**.  Please bring a hard copy to class.  If you cannot attend class on April 14, contact me in advance to discuss electronic submission of the assignment.  I will accept late assignments until the beginning of class on April 16, with a letter-grade penalty for lateness.  If you have not turned in the assignment by then, your grade will be zero.

[^formatting]: Page counts assume a document written in 12-point font, double-spaced, with one-inch margins.  Six pages is a maximum and should not be interpreted as an expectation.  Use as much space as is required to make a sound argumentâ€”no more, no less.

[^honesty]: I take academic honesty seriously, and you should too.  Familiarize yourself with the Student Handbook, particularly the section on ["The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/#the-honor-code-applied-to-preparation-of-papers)  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse.


# Prompts

1. Imagine that there are two kinds of democratic leaders: "charismatic" leaders who can manipulate domestic public opinion at will, and "dreary" leaders who cannot.[^domestic]  Which kind of leader can achieve better outcomes for a democracy in international negotiations, and why?

2. In two separate studies,[^leeds] Leeds argues that democracies are better able to make commitments to each other because they face relatively high costs of reneging on agreements.  A potential alternative explanation for her findings is that democracies follow through because their foreign policy preferences tend to be aligned, not because they would face a penalty for backing out.

    Do Leeds' empirical findings allow us to distinguish between these two explanations?  In other words, does she find anything in her data that the costs-based theory would predict but the interests-based theory would not (or vice versa)?  If so, what?  If not, what kind of data could provide this distinction?

[^domestic]: Assume the charm only works at home, so neither type of leader can directly sway foreign opinion.

[^leeds]: "Domestic Political Institutions, Credible Commitments, and International Cooperation" and "Alliance Reliability in Times of War."
