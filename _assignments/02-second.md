# Instructions

Your task is to write a short paper that addresses one (and only one!) of the following questions.  Your paper should not exceed six pages, not including references.[^formatting] This is not a research paper: you should be able to answer any of the following questions satisfactorily using only works from the syllabus.  Of course, you are welcome to use other sources if they are relevant to your argument.  You must cite all sources (including works from the syllabus) and adhere to the other standards of academic honesty laid out in the syllabus.[^honesty]

The paper is due to me at the beginning of class on **Tuesday, March 24**.  Please bring a hard copy to class.  If you cannot attend class on March 24, contact me in advance to discuss electronic submission of the assignment.  I will accept late assignments until the beginning of class on March 26, with a letter-grade penalty for lateness.  If you have not turned in the assignment by then, your grade will be zero.

[^formatting]: Page counts assume a document written in 12-point font, double-spaced, with one-inch margins.  Six pages is a maximum and should not be interpreted as an expectation.  Use as much space as is required to make a sound argument—no more, no less.

[^honesty]: I take academic honesty seriously, and you should too.  Familiarize yourself with the Student Handbook, particularly the section on ["The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/#the-honor-code-applied-to-preparation-of-papers)  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse.


# Prompts

1. Huth and Russett's empirical analysis of extended immediate deterrence yields a paradoxical finding: when there is an alliance between the defender and the protegé, an attacker is less likely to be deterred, even though the defender is more likely to follow through on its threat.  Using the theories of alliance formation and commitment we have discussed in class, develop a coherent explanation for this surprising finding.

2. In class we discussed three of Walt's models of alliance formation: the power politics model, the state similarity model, and the foreign aid/bribes model.  Compare and contrast the commitment and signaling value of any *two* of these types of alliance.  Which is more effective at each role, and why?
