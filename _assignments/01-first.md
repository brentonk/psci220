# Instructions

Your task is to write a short paper that addresses one (and only one!) of the following questions.  Your paper should not exceed six pages, not including references.[^formatting] This is not a research paper: you should be able to answer any of the following questions satisfactorily using only works from the syllabus.  Of course, you are welcome to use other sources if they are relevant to your argument.  You must cite all sources (including works from the syllabus) and adhere to the other standards of academic honesty laid out in the syllabus.[^honesty]

The paper is due to me at the beginning of class on **Tuesday, February 17**.  Please bring a hard copy to class.  If you cannot attend class on February 17, contact me in advance to discuss electronic submission of the assignment.  I will accept late assignments until the beginning of class on February 19, with a letter-grade penalty for lateness.  If you have not turned in the assignment by then, you will receive a grade of zero.

[^formatting]: Page counts assume a document written in 12-point font, double-spaced, with one-inch margins.  Six pages is a maximum and should not be interpreted as an expectation.  Use as much space as is required to make a sound argument---no more, no less.

[^honesty]: I take academic honesty seriously, and you should too.  Familiarize yourself with the Student Handbook, particularly the section on ["The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/#the-honor-code-applied-to-preparation-of-papers)  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse.


# Prompts

1. Morgenthau argues that it is dangerous to conduct diplomacy in public: "Not only is a publicly conducted diplomacy unable to reach agreement or even to negotiate for the purpose of reaching agreement, but each public meeting leaves international matters in a worse state than before" (p. 579).  Is this contention compatible with deterrence theory, the spiral model, or neither?  Explain why.

2. In class I raised the following objection to the spiral model: that deterrent threats (as opposed to compellent ones) should not set off security dilemmas.  Explain why my contention is incorrect.

3. The Prisoners' Dilemma and Stag Hunt can both be thought of as "realist" models of international politics.  Identify a feature of Keohane and Nye's liberal theory that should be incorporated into these models.  Explain how you would modify each model to account for this feature, and show how (if at all) each model's conclusions about conflict and cooperation would change.
