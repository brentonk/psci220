# Instructions

Your task is to write a short paper that addresses one (and only one!) of the
following questions.  Your paper should not exceed six pages, not including
references.[^formatting] This is not a research paper: you should be able to
answer any of the following questions satisfactorily using only works from the
syllabus.  Of course, you are welcome to use other sources if they are
relevant to your argument.  You must cite all sources (including works from
the syllabus) and adhere to the other standards of academic honesty laid out
in the syllabus.

The paper is due to me at the beginning of class on **Wednesday, November
19**.  Please bring a hard copy to class.  If you cannot attend class on
November 19, contact me in advance to discuss electronic submission of the
assignment.  I will accept late assignments until 9:10 a.m. on November 21,
with a letter-grade penalty for lateness.  If you have not turned in the
assignment by then, you will receive a grade of zero.


# Prompts

Each prompt places you in the shoes of a hypothetical political actor.  Your
answer should draw from the political science concepts and readings we have
discussed in class, not just your gut feelings about the situation.

1. You are the president of the United States.  The New York Times has just
   revealed that Grogistan, a dictatorship with a history of hostility toward
   the U.S., completed a successful nuclear weapons test last week.  You want
   to compel Grogistan to halt its nuclear program and destroy its arsenal.
   Meanwhile, your top priority is to win a second term, and Election Day is
   in one month.  Do you issue a threat to Grogistan publicly or try to
   negotiate in private?  Why?

2. You are the president-for-life of Grogistan, a peaceful socialist republic.
   You have developed a nuclear weapon to act as a deterrent against foreign
   invasion.  In order to know whether the weapon works---and in order for it
   to have any deterrent value---you must test it.  Your biggest enemy, the
   United States, is holding an election in one month.  Do you undertake the
   nuclear test now, or wait until after the election?  Why?

3. You are the prime minister of the United Kingdom, longtime ally of the
   United States.  You have received a telephone call from the president of
   the U.S., who claims the U.S. is under threat from Grogistan and the
   U.K. is obligated (per NATO provisions) to come to its aid.  Recent opinion
   polls show that the British public opposes further entanglement in U.S.-led
   wars abroad.  How do you respond to the president's call?  How much aid, if
   any, do you offer?  Why?

4. You are the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The United States and
   Grogistan have been at war for three years, and the fighting seems unlikely
   to stop soon.  You are determined to end the war and build a lasting peace.
   You may try to recruit another state to serve as a mediator---perhaps a
   neutral state like Switzerland or a U.S. ally like Canada.  You may ask the
   Security Council to authorize a peacekeeping force of its own to intervene.
   Or you may do nothing.  What do you do, and why?

[^formatting]: Page counts are based on a paper written in 12-point font,
    double-spaced, with one-inch margins.  Six pages is a maximum and should
    not be interpreted as an expectation.  Use as much space as is required to
    make a sound argument---no more, no less.  I reserve the right not to read
    any content beyond six pages and to reduce your grade for exceeding the
    page limit.
