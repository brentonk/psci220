# Instructions

Your task is to write a short paper that addresses one (and only one!) of the
following questions.  Your paper should not exceed six pages, not including
references.[^formatting] This is not a research paper: you should be able to
answer any of the following questions satisfactorily using only works from the
syllabus.  Of course, you are welcome to use other sources if they are
relevant to your argument.  You must cite all sources (including works from
the syllabus) and adhere to the other standards of academic honesty laid out
in the syllabus.

The paper is due to me at the beginning of class on **Wednesday, October 1**.
Please bring a hard copy to class.  If you cannot attend class on October 1,
contact me in advance to discuss electronic submission of the assignment.  I
will accept late assignments until the beginning of class on October 3, with a
letter-grade penalty for lateness.  If you have not turned in the assignment
by then, you will receive a grade of zero.


# Prompts

1. Morgenthau argues that the world would be more peaceful if diplomacy were
   conducted among professional diplomats behind closed doors, as was common
   before World War I, rather than through public forums like international
   organizations.  Evaluate his argument from the standpoint of rational
   deterrence theory.  Are deterrent threats more likely to succeed, and thus
   prevent war, under the "old" diplomacy or the "new" diplomacy (or neither)?

2. Schelling writes, "[I]t does not always help to be, or to be believed to
   be, fully rational, cool-headed, and in control of oneself or of one's
   country" (p. 37).  Evaluate how the nature of a threat---specifically,
   whether it aims to deter or to compel---affects the strategic logic of
   appearing to be irrational.  Does having a reputation for irrationality
   affect the success of one type of threat more than the other?  In which
   situation is a reputation for irrationality easier to establish?

3. Consider the structure and practices of the diplomatic system in the 17th
   and 18th centuries, as described by Anderson.  Which of Jervis's two
   theoretical frameworks, the deterrence model and the spiral model, better
   describes the diplomacy of this era?  Why?

[^formatting]: Page counts are based on a paper written in 12-point font,
    double-spaced, with one-inch margins.  Six pages is a maximum and should
    not be interpreted as an expectation.  Use as much space as is required
    to make a sound argument---no more, no less.
