Talk is cheap in international politics.  There is no world government or other central authority to keep states from lying, bluffing, and breaking promises to each other.  So what is the point of diplomacy?  Can talking accomplish anything that force cannot?  When, if ever, are international threats and promises believable?  What kinds of states or leaders are most likely to follow through on their commitments?  In short, how can a state make its words *credible*?

This course will not teach you the answers to these questions.  Even if they had definitive answers, there is no expert consensus on what those answers are.  What we will learn, instead, is how to think through crisis diplomacy in a scientific way.  We will take a two-pronged approach.  First, just to make our task intellectually manageable, we will build theoretical models of crisis diplomacy---deliberate oversimplifications of reality that allow us to focus on some important aspects of crises.  Second, to evaluate the conclusions we draw from these models, we will review them through the lens of empirical evidence.  No theory will ever fit the data perfectly, but some claims will find more support than others.

Sadly, this course will not turn you into an expert diplomat or a master negotiator.  It will, however, give you a framework to critically evaluate the things that politicians, pundits, and scholars say about foreign policy and international crises.


# Grading

Your grade in PSCI 2220 will be based on:

* **Critical Response Papers (20%).**  You will write two critical response papers, no more than four pages each,[^page-lengths] throughout the semester.  In each paper, you will choose a course reading of particular interest to you and make a critical argument about its central claims.  For more details, see the handout on critical response papers.

* **Midterm Exam (20%).** We will have an in-class midterm consisting of short essay questions on February 25.  *If you cannot be in class on February 25, please let me know as soon as possible so we can make alternative arrangements.*

* **Final Paper (50%).** The bulk of your grade is based on a research paper. The task of the final paper is to evaluate a hypothesis about an aspect of diplomacy in light of a historical or recent case.  You should be thinking about potential paper topics all semester long.  As we proceed through the schedule of readings, take time to consider which of the research questions we encounter are most interesting to you.

    There are three parts to the final paper:

    * *Proposal.* You will write a 1--2 page proposal summarizing (1) the research question you are going to address and (2) the historical or current-event evidence you will draw from.  The proposal itself is not graded, but I will not accept your final paper submission unless you have submitted a proposal and I have approved it.  Proposals are due in class on Tuesday, March 22.

    * *Presentation.* In the last few class sessions, each student will deliver a brief (5--10 minute) presentation in class about his or her research design and preliminary findings.  One-fifth of the grade for your paper (and thus 10% of your course grade) is based on your presentation.

    * *Paper.* The paper itself should be about 15 pages long, and cannot exceed 20 pages (not including references).  It is due at 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 28, which falls within the time that would ordinarily be reserved for the final exam.

    For more details, see the handout on final papers.

* **Class Participation (10%).**  This class is a seminar, and your participation is crucial for its success. I expect you not only to attend class, but also to have completed the readings and prepared to discuss them.  Your attendance, preparation, and engagement in class discussion will all be reflected in your participation grade.

[^page-lengths]: Page lengths quoted assume a double-spaced document with 12-point text and 1-inch margins.


# Academic Integrity

As in all courses at Vanderbilt, your work in PSCI 2220 is governed by the Honor Code.  I encourage you to discuss course material and assignments with your peers, but the written work you turn in must be solely your own.

I have no tolerance for plagiarism.  If you turn in plagiarized work, you will receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the Honor Council.  Plagiarism is not just verbatim copying and pasting---representing someone else's ideas as your own without citing the source is also a form of plagiarism.  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse or a defense.  For more information about what is and is not plagiarism, refer to [the Student Handbook section on the Honor System](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/), particularly the section "The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."  Always remember: *when in doubt, cite.*

The midterm will be open-book and open-notes, but electronic devices will not be allowed.  Accordingly, you may want to buy hard copies of the required books instead of e-books.
