# Description

The purpose of this class is to analyze theories of diplomacy---the management
of international affairs through means other than the use of force.  We will
address questions like: Does a state become more or less secure when it issues
threats to its adversaries?  What types of states are most likely to form
alliances, or honor their alliance commitments?  When can third-party
mediators effectively keep international disputes from escalating into war?
Is "diplomatic" contact between states and terrorist groups even possible,
let alone advisable for the states in question?

More broadly speaking, this class is designed to teach you how to approach
international politics from a scientific standpoint.  This entails developing
a particular type of critical thinking: to formulate ideas about politics in
terms of scientific theories, and to use empirical evidence to evaluate those
theories.  To this end, most of the course readings are drawn from the
political science literature of the past two decades.  Since the majority of
such research uses quantitative analysis in one form or another, this means
you will inevitably run into some math.  But don't panic!  This course does
not require any math background, and you will not be tested on mathematical
concepts.  Even when we read material with a quantitative component, our focus
will be on theories, hypotheses, and research design---not mathematical
details.


# Grading

Your grade in PSCI 220 consists of the following components:

* **Short Papers (20%).** You will write two short papers (5--7 pages
    each).[^page-lengths] You will select the topic of each paper from a set
    of prompts that will be handed out a week before the paper is due.  The
    first of these papers will be due October 1, and the second will be due
    November 19.

*   **Midterm Exam (20%).** An in-class midterm consisting of short essay
    questions will be held on October 6.  *If you cannot be present in class
    on October 6, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can make
    alternative arrangements.*

*   **Final Paper (50%).** The bulk of your grade is based on a research paper.
    The task of the final paper is to evaluate a hypothesis about an aspect of
    diplomacy in light of a historical or recent case.  I will provide greater
    detail about the final paper assignment, including examples of good
    topics, in October.  But you should be thinking about the paper in general
    terms from the start of the class.  As we proceed through the schedule of
    readings, take time to consider which of the research questions we
    encounter are most interesting to you.

    There are three parts to the final paper:

    * *Proposal.* You will write a 1--2 page proposal summarizing (1) the
      research question you are going to address and (2) the historical or
      current-event evidence you will draw from.  Proposals are due
      November 5.  The sole purpose of the proposal is for me to ensure that
      your topic is relevant and manageable before you begin researching and
      writing your paper.  The proposal itself, though required, will not be
      graded.

    * *Presentation.* In the final week of class, each student will deliver
      a brief (5--10 minute) presentation in class about his or her research
      design and preliminary findings.  One-fifth of the grade for your paper
      (and thus 10% of your course grade) is based on your presentation.

    * *Paper.* The paper itself should be about 15 pages long, and cannot
      exceed 20 pages (not including references).  It is due to me at 5:00
      p.m. on Thursday, December 11, which falls within the time that would
      ordinarily be reserved for the final exam.

* **Class Participation (10%).** This class is a seminar, and your
  participation is crucial for its success.  I expect you not only to attend
  class, but also to have completed the readings and prepared to discuss them.
  Your attendance, preparation, and engagement in class discussion will all be
  reflected in your participation grade.

[^page-lengths]: Page lengths quoted assume a double-spaced document with
    12-point text and 1-inch margins.


# Academic Integrity

As in all courses at Vanderbilt, your work in PSCI 220 is governed by the
Honor Code.  I encourage you to discuss course material and assignments with
your peers, but the written work you turn in must be solely your own.  You are
required to write and sign the Honor Pledge on all written assignments and
examinations: "I pledge on my honor that I have neither given nor received
unauthorized aid on this assignment."

I have no tolerance for plagiarism.  If you turn in plagiarized work, you will
receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the Honor Council.
Plagiarism is not just verbatim copying and pasting---representing someone
else's ideas as your own without citing the source is also a form of
plagiarism.  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse or a
defense.  For more information about what is and is not plagiarism, refer to
[the Student Handbook section on the Honor System](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/).
Always remember: *when in doubt, cite.*


# Additional Concerns

## Special Accommodations

If you need course accommodations due to a disability, if you have emergency
medical information to share with me, or if you need special arrangements in
case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me or
with the
[Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/)
(2-4705) as soon as possible.

## Classroom Recording

The use of technologies for audio and video recording of lectures and other
classroom activities is allowed only with the express permission of the
instructor.  In cases where recordings are allowed, such content is restricted
to personal use only unless permission is expressly granted in writing by the
instructor and by other classroom participants, including other
students.  Personal use is defined as use by an individual student for the
purpose of studying or completing course assignments.  When students have
permission for personal use of recordings, they must still obtain written
permission from the instructor to share recordings with others.
 
For students registered with EAD and who have been approved for audio or video
recording of lectures and other classroom activities as a reasonable
accommodation, applicable federal law requires instructors to permit those
recordings.  Such recordings are also limited to personal use, except with
permission of the instructor and other students in the class.
