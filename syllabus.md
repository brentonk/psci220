# Academic Integrity

As in all courses at Vanderbilt, your work in PSCI 220 is governed by the
Honor Code.  I encourage you to discuss course material and assignments with
your peers, but the written work you turn in must be solely your own.  You are
required to write and sign the Honor Pledge on all written assignments and
examinations: "I pledge on my honor that I have neither given nor received
unauthorized aid on this assignment."

I have no tolerance for plagiarism.  If you turn in plagiarized work, you will
receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the Honor Council.
Plagiarism is not just verbatim copying and pasting---representing someone
else's ideas as your own without citing the source is also a form of
plagiarism.  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse or a
defense.  For more information about what is and is not plagiarism, refer to
[the Student Handbook section on the Honor System](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/).
Always remember: *when in doubt, cite.*


# Additional Concerns

## Special Accommodations

If you need course accommodations due to a disability, if you have emergency
medical information to share with me, or if you need special arrangements in
case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me or
with the
[Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/)
(2-4705) as soon as possible.

## Classroom Recording

The use of technologies for audio and video recording of lectures and other
classroom activities is allowed only with the express permission of the
instructor.  In cases where recordings are allowed, such content is restricted
to personal use only unless permission is expressly granted in writing by the
instructor and by other classroom participants, including other
students.  Personal use is defined as use by an individual student for the
purpose of studying or completing course assignments.  When students have
permission for personal use of recordings, they must still obtain written
permission from the instructor to share recordings with others.
 
For students registered with EAD and who have been approved for audio or video
recording of lectures and other classroom activities as a reasonable
accommodation, applicable federal law requires instructors to permit those
recordings.  Such recordings are also limited to personal use, except with
permission of the instructor and other students in the class.
