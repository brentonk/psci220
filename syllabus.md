# Description

Talk is cheap in international politics.  There is no world government or other central authority to keep states from lying, bluffing, and breaking promises to each other.  So what is the point of diplomacy?  Can talking accomplish anything that force cannot?  When, if ever, are international threats and promises believable?  What kinds of states or leaders are most likely to follow through on their commitments?  In short, how can a state make its words *credible*?

This course will not teach you the answers to these questions.  Even if they had definitive answers, there is no expert consensus on what those answers are.  What we will learn, instead, is how to think through crisis diplomacy in a scientific way.  We will take a two-pronged approach.  First, just to make our task intellectually manageable, we will build theoretical models of crisis diplomacy---deliberate oversimplifications of reality that allow us to focus on some important aspects of crises.  Second, to evaluate the conclusions we draw from these models, we will review them through the lens of empirical evidence.  No theory will ever fit the data perfectly, but some claims will find more support than others.

Sadly, this course will not turn you into an expert diplomat or a master negotiator.  It will, however, give you a framework to critically evaluate the things that politicians, pundits, and scholars[^tip] say about foreign policy and international crises.

[^tip]: You could add "your relatives" to this list, but it's definitely not diplomatic to spend the holidays subjecting your family's political views to a scientific analysis.


# Grading

Your grade in PSCI 220 will be based on:

* **Short Papers (33%).** You will write three short papers (4--6 pages each).[^page-lengths] You will select the topic of each paper from a set of prompts that will be handed out a week before the paper is due.  The due dates are listed in the schedule of readings.

* **Midterm Exam (33%).** An in-class midterm consisting of short essay questions will be held on February 24.  *If you cannot be present in class on February 24, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements.*

* **Final Exam (33%).** The final exam will be held at the time designated by the university, April 27 at 9:00 a.m.

* The last percentage point is free.

Both exams will be open-book and open-notes, but electronic devices will not be allowed.  Accordingly, you may want to buy hard copies of the required books instead of e-books.

[^page-lengths]: Page lengths quoted assume a double-spaced document with 12-point text and 1-inch margins.


# Academic Integrity

As in all courses at Vanderbilt, your work in PSCI 220 is governed by the Honor Code.  I encourage you to discuss course material and assignments with your peers, but the written work you turn in must be solely your own.

I have no tolerance for plagiarism.  If you turn in plagiarized work, you will receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the Honor Council.  Plagiarism is not just verbatim copying and pasting---representing someone else's ideas as your own without citing the source is also a form of plagiarism.  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse or a defense.  For more information about what is and is not plagiarism, refer to [the Student Handbook section on the Honor System](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/), particularly the section "The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."  Always remember: *when in doubt, cite.*


# Special Accommodations

If you need course accommodations due to a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me or with the [Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/) (2-4705) as soon as possible.  Please also consult with me if you need to make audio or video recordings of lectures as part of a reasonable accommodation approved by EAD.


# Books

The following books are required:

* Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow, [*Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis*](http://amzn.com/0321013492), 2nd ed. (Pearson, 1999).[^allison-edition]

* Thomas Schelling, [*Arms and Influence*](http://amzn.com/0300002211) (Yale University Press, 1966).

[^allison-edition]: The first and second editions of *Essence of Decision* differ substantially, so I require that you use the second.


# Schedule

The schedule of readings is tentative and is subject to change.  I will inform you at least a week in advance of any changes to the required readings.

Links to all journal articles are available in the syllabus on the course website, <http://bkenkel.com/psci220/syllabus.html>.  Scans of book chapters will be made available through [OAK](http://oak.vanderbilt.edu).

In accordance with the goal of learning to think like political scientists, the readings are largely drawn from the political science literature of the past two decades.  Many of these papers, like most contemporary political science research, contain some math.  But don't panic!  You will not be tested on mathematical concepts, and our focus will always be on theories, hypotheses, research design, and evidence---not mathematical details.
